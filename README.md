## Introduction
AI agents are systems capable of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of users by designing workflows and utilizing available tools.

## What are AI Agents?
An AI agent refers to a system or program that autonomously performs tasks on behalf of a user or another system.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines traditional information retrieval systems with generative large language models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated content.

## Implementation Flow

## Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Advantages**: Enhanced task performance, real-time information retrieval, and adaptability.
- **Disadvantages**: Complexity in implementation and potential over-reliance on AI.
